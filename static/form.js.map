This means that we can\n\t *  pass HTML tag properties directly into the BeforeAfterWrapper tag.\n\t *\n\t *  When using BeforeAfterWrapper, ensure that the parent of the beforeElement\n\t *  and afterElement have a defined style position.\n\t */\n\t\n\tvar styles = {\n\t  box: {\n\t    boxSizing: 'border-box'\n\t  }\n\t};\n\t\n\tvar BeforeAfterWrapper = _react2.default.createClass({\n\t  displayName: 'BeforeAfterWrapper',\n\t\n\t\n\t  propTypes: {\n\t    afterElementType: _react2.default.PropTypes.string,\n\t    afterStyle: _react2.default.PropTypes.object,\n\t    beforeElementType: _react2.default.PropTypes.string,\n\t    beforeStyle: _react2.default.PropTypes.object,\n\t    children: _react2.default.PropTypes.node,\n\t    elementType: _react2.default.PropTypes.string,\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t     * Override the inline-styles of the root element.\n\t     */\n\t    style: _react2.default.PropTypes.object\n\t  },\n\t\n\t  contextTypes: {\n\t    muiTheme: _react2.default.PropTypes.object\n\t  },\n\t\n\t  childContextTypes: {\n\t    muiTheme: _react2.default.PropTypes.object\n\t  },\n\t\n\t  getDefaultProps: function getDefaultProps() {\n\t    return {\n\t      beforeElementType: 'div',\n\t      afterElementType: 'div',\n\t      elementType: 'div'\n\t    };\n\t  },\n\t  getInitialState: function getInitialState() {\n\t    return {\n\t      muiTheme: this.context.muiTheme || (0, _getMuiTheme2.default)()\n\t    };\n\t  },\n\t  getChildContext: function getChildContext() {\n\t    return {\n\t      muiTheme: this.state.muiTheme\n\t    };\n\t  },\n\t  componentWillReceiveProps: function componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps, nextContext) {\n\t    this.setState({\n\t      muiTheme: nextContext.muiTheme || this.state.muiTheme\n\t    });\n\t  },\n\t  render: function render() {\n\t    var _props = this.props;\n\t    var beforeStyle = _props.beforeStyle;\n\t    var afterStyle = _props.afterStyle;\n\t    var beforeElementType = _props.beforeElementType;\n\t    var afterElementType = _props.afterElementType;\n\t    var elementType = _props.elementType;\n\t\n\t    var other = _objectWithoutProperties(_props, ['beforeStyle', 'afterStyle', 'beforeElementType', 'afterElementType', 'elementType']);\n\t\n\t    var prepareStyles = this.state.muiTheme.prepareStyles;\n\t\n\t\n\t    var beforeElement = void 0;\n\t    var afterElement = void 0;\n\t\n\t    if (beforeStyle) {\n\t      beforeElement = _react2.default.createElement(this.props.beforeElementType, {\n\t        style: prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, styles.box, beforeStyle)),\n\t        key: '::before'\n\t      });\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    if (afterStyle) {\n\t      afterElement = _react2.default.createElement(this.props.afterElementType, {\n\t        style: prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, styles.box, afterStyle)),\n\t        key: '::after'\n\t      });\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    var children = [beforeElement, this.props.children, afterElement];\n\t\n\t    var props = other;\n\t    props.style = prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, this.props.style));\n\t\n\t    return _react2.default.createElement(this.props.elementType, props, children);\n\t  }\n\t});\n\t\n\texports.default = BeforeAfterWrapper;\n\n/***/ },\n/* 261 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\tObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n\t  value: true\n\t});\n\t\n\tvar _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; };\n\t\n\tvar _react = __webpack_require__(7);\n\t\n\tvar _react2 = _interopRequireDefault(_react);\n\t\n\tvar _beforeAfterWrapper = __webpack_require__(260);\n\t\n\tvar _beforeAfterWrapper2 = _interopRequireDefault(_beforeAfterWrapper);\n\t\n\tfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ?

This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.\n *\n *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks. This\n *    may be done in the worker thread.\n *\n *  - Forward these native events (with the associated top-level type used to\n *    trap it) to `EventPluginHub`, which in turn will ask plugins if they want\n *    to extract any synthetic events.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` will then process each event by annotating them with\n *    \"dispatches\", a sequence of listeners and IDs that care about that event.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` then dispatches the events.\n *\n * Overview of React and the event system:\n *\n * +------------+    .\n * |    DOM     |    .\n * +------------+    .\n *       |           .\n *       v           .\n * +------------+    .\n * | ReactEvent |    .\n * |  Listener  |    .\n * +------------+    .                         +-----------+\n *       |           .               +--------+|SimpleEvent|\n *       |           .               |         |Plugin     |\n * +-----|------+    .               v         +-----------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+                    +------------+\n * |     +-----------.--->|EventPluginHub|                    |    Event   |\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  | Propagators|\n * | ReactEvent |    .    |              |     |TapEvent   |  |------------|\n * |  Emitter   |    .    |              |<---+|Plugin     |  |other plugin|\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  |  utilities |\n * |     +-----------.--->|              |                    +------------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+\n * +-----|------+    .                ^        +-----------+\n *       |           .                |        |Enter/Leave|\n *       +           .                +-------+|Plugin     |\n * +-------------+   .                         +-----------+\n * | application |   .\n * |-------------|   .\n * |             |   .\n * |             |   .\n * +-------------+   .\n *                   .\n *    React Core     .

If the element\n *    that we want to apply before and after elements is a HTML tag (i.e. a\n *    div, p, or button tag), we can avoid this extra nesting by passing using\n *    the BeforeAfterWrapper in place of said tag like so:\n *\n *  <p>\n *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>   do this instead   <BeforeAfterWrapper elementType='p'>\n *      [children of p]          ------>         [children of p]\n *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                    </BeforeAfterWrapper>\n *  </p>\n *\n *  BeforeAfterWrapper features spread functionality. This means that we can\n *  pass HTML tag properties directly into the BeforeAfterWrapper tag.\n *\n *  When using BeforeAfterWrapper, ensure that the parent of the beforeElement\n *  and afterElement have a defined style position.\n */\n\nvar styles = {\n  box: {\n    boxSizing: 'border-box'\n  }\n};\n\nvar BeforeAfterWrapper = _react2.default.createClass({\n  displayName: 'BeforeAfterWrapper',\n\n\n  propTypes: {\n    afterElementType: _react2.default.PropTypes.string,\n    afterStyle: _react2.default.PropTypes.object,\n    beforeElementType: _react2.default.PropTypes.string,\n    beforeStyle: _react2.default.PropTypes.object,\n    children: _react2.default.PropTypes.node,\n    elementType: _react2.default.PropTypes.string,\n\n    /**\n     * Override the inline-styles of the root element.\n     */\n    style: _react2.default.PropTypes.object\n  },\n\n  contextTypes: {\n    muiTheme: _react2.default.PropTypes.object\n  },\n\n  childContextTypes: {\n    muiTheme: _react2.default.PropTypes.object\n  },\n\n  getDefaultProps: function getDefaultProps() {\n    return {\n      beforeElementType: 'div',\n      afterElementType: 'div',\n      elementType: 'div'\n    };\n  },\n  getInitialState: function getInitialState() {\n    return {\n      muiTheme: this.context.muiTheme || (0, _getMuiTheme2.default)()\n    };\n  },\n  getChildContext: function getChildContext() {\n    return {\n      muiTheme: this.state.muiTheme\n    };\n  },\n  componentWillReceiveProps: function componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps, nextContext) {\n    this.setState({\n      muiTheme: nextContext.muiTheme || this.state.muiTheme\n    });\n  },\n  render: function render() {\n    var _props = this.props;\n    var beforeStyle = _props.beforeStyle;\n    var afterStyle = _props.afterStyle;\n    var beforeElementType = _props.beforeElementType;\n    var afterElementType = _props.afterElementType;\n    var elementType = _props.elementType;\n\n    var other = _objectWithoutProperties(_props, ['beforeStyle', 'afterStyle', 'beforeElementType', 'afterElementType', 'elementType']);\n\n    var prepareStyles = this.state.muiTheme.prepareStyles;\n\n\n    var beforeElement = void 0;\n    var afterElement = void 0;\n\n    if (beforeStyle) {\n      beforeElement = _react2.default.createElement(this.props.beforeElementType, {\n        style: prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, styles.box, beforeStyle)),\n        key: '::before'\n      });\n    }\n\n    if (afterStyle) {\n      afterElement = _react2.default.createElement(this.props.afterElementType, {\n        style: prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, styles.box, afterStyle)),\n        key: '::after'\n      });\n    }\n\n    var children = [beforeElement, this.props.children, afterElement];\n\n    var props = other;\n    props.style = prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, this.props.style));\n\n    return _react2.default.createElement(this.props.elementType, props, children);\n  }\n});\n\nexports.default = BeforeAfterWrapper;\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/material-ui/lib/before-after-wrapper.js\n ** module id = 260\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","'use strict';\n\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n  value: true\n});\n\nvar _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; };\n\nvar _react = require('react');\n\nvar _react2 = _interopRequireDefault(_react);\n\nvar _beforeAfterWrapper = require('./before-after-wrapper');\n\nvar _beforeAfterWrapper2 = _interopRequireDefault(_beforeAfterWrapper);\n\nfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ?

Methods that operate on and return arrays, collections, and\n * functions can be chained together. Methods that retrieve a single value or\n * may return a primitive value will automatically end the chain sequence and\n * return the unwrapped value. Otherwise, the value must be unwrapped with\n * `_#value`.\n *\n * Explicit chaining, which must be unwrapped with `_#value` in all cases,\n * may be enabled using `_.chain`.\n *\n * The execution of chained methods is lazy, that is, it's deferred until\n * `_#value` is implicitly or explicitly called.\n *\n * Lazy evaluation allows several methods to support shortcut fusion. Shortcut\n * fusion is an optimization to merge iteratee calls; this avoids the creation\n * of intermediate arrays and can greatly reduce the number of iteratee executions.\n * Sections of a chain sequence qualify for shortcut fusion if the section is\n * applied to an array of at least two hundred elements and any iteratees\n * accept only one argument. The heuristic for whether a section qualifies\n * for shortcut fusion is subject to change.\n *\n * Chaining is supported in custom builds as long as the `_#value` method is\n * directly or indirectly included in the build.\n *\n * In addition to lodash methods, wrappers have `Array` and `String` methods.\n *\n * The wrapper `Array` methods are:\n * `concat`, `join`, `pop`, `push`, `shift`, `sort`,
